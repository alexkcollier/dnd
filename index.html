      <h1>Races</h1>

      <h2>Dragonborn</h2>

      <p>Unable to reproduce, dragonborn are exceptionally rare. They can only be created by true dragons, the means of which
        are not understood. Since dragons must go out of their way to create dragonborn, they are often created to serve
        a specific purpose which they rarely deviate from. As a result, many are exceptionally wary of the chromatic variants.</p>

      <h2>Dwarves</h2>

      <p>Dwarves believe the entire world is a large, sleeping dwarf. The winds are its breath, waters its tears, and dwarves
        themselves were formed in its womb beneath the ground. They are widespread, but have a deep-seated fear of water
        where they believe the grave is. Ancestor worship is common among dwarves, and many follow the barbarian Path of
        the Ancestral Guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>Elves</h2>

      <p>Elves see themselves as children of the heavenly bodies. Wood elves are the children of the day, dark elves are children
        of the night, and high elves are children of the sun, or moon. Notably, not all dark elves are hated and reviled,
        nor do they primarily dwell in the Underdark. They are simply elves that are primarily nocturnal. </p>

      <h2>Gnomes</h2>

      <p>Like dwarves, gnomes see their origins in the earth. Not in the depths, but rather the stones on the surface. Many
        gnomes dedicate themselves to discovery and innovation, but tribes of wild gnomes have been known to raid small villages.
        These gnomes attack with terrifying ferocity and cruel spiked armor. This fighting style and their small size has
        earned them the nickname <em>burrs</em>.</p>

      <h3>Wild Gnomes</h3>

      <p>Wild gnomes often follow the path of a barbarian. Those trained in the use of spiked armor may take the Path of the
        Battlerager.
      </p>

      <p><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>

      <p><b><i>Bad Reputation.</i></b> You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>

      <p><b><i>Fury of the Small.</i></b> When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger
        than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your
        level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Halflings</h2>

      <p>Halflings are one of the oldest races in the world, their small stature enabling them to go unnoticed among the early
        titans and primordials. Ruined halfling civilizations from ages past are not uncommon.</p>

      <h2>Humans</h2>

      <p>Humans are widespread and diverse. No one is sure of their origins, although some believe that humans are simply tall
        halflings. They are highly adaptable, often taking on traits from other races that live near them. For example, humans
        who have been exposed to dwarves may follow the Path of the Ancestral Guardian, or those who live near elves may
        have learned Bladesong.
      </p>

      <p>Many humans are naturally quite talented. To reflect this, you can use the variant human, taking a feat reflecting
        this natural talent. Alternatively, if you use the base human, you gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your
        choice.

    <div id="Religion" class="pure-u-1 pure-u-lg-3-4 content">

      <h1>Religion</h1>

      <h2>The Grey Faith</h2>

      <p>The main religion in civilized areas is the Grey Faith. It holds the premise that the world is composed of Light and
        Dark, and one cannot exist without the other. The Light is usually associated with life, joy, victory, and art, while
        the Dark is associated with death, loss, secrecy, and sleep. There are adherents who are drawn toward either the
        Light or the Dark, but as elements of Dark and Light are heavily entwined in all aspects of life and the world, they
        are most commonly venerated together. It is this blending from which the Faith takes its name.</p>

      <p>Dark and Light are not viewed as deities, as that entire concept is from a less enlightened time. Instead, it is more
        accurate to view them as energies, or forces. At first glance, it may seem that Light represents goodness, and Dark
        represents evil, this is not entirely true. The pursuit of joy has led many to fall into depraved lives, and the
        recovery from loss has formed the most celebrated heroes.</p>

      <p>Clerics of the Grey Faith may belong to any domain, depending on how that manifests. Knowledge, Light, and Trickery
        are most common for Grey, Light, and Dark clerics, respectively. Many of the Grey Faith's clergy are not clerics,
        but monks or paladins instead. Clerics devote themselves to the care of all, monks to the pursuit of self-perfection
        and enlightenment, and paladins to specific causes of the faith.</p>

      <h2>Folk Religion</h2>

      <p>As you move further from the major cities, the concept of deities grows more prevalent. In small towns and villages,
        stories are told of when powerful beings formed the world and warred against each other. Not wishing to mar their
        creation further, they have since retreated from the physical world, though their influence can still be felt. Many
        pantheons of deities have been suggested. The most popular is shown below, however others still hold sway.</p>

      <p>The concept of deities becomes less common again as you move into older, wilder places. Here, religions become animistic
        instead, and for good reason. In these old, untamed places, there are rumours that powerful spirits manifest and
        walk through them.</p>

      <p><b>Asmodeus</b> is the evil god of tyranny, domination and sin. He is the King of Hell, ruling the Nine Hells of Baator,
        the Duke of the Ninth, Nessus, and father of Glasya, Duke of the Sixth Hell, Malbolge.</p>

      <p>Asmodeus was once an archangel and exarch serving a god now only known as He Who Was, the god of good and peace and
        possibly the creator of humanity. Asmodeus betrayed his god, killing him and having the devils erase all knowledge
        of the god's name for fear that the mere mention of it would revive him. This transformed Baator from the realm of
        He Who Was to the Nine Hells of Baator, a prison for Asmodeus and the devils.</p>

      <p>The god of change, <b>Avandra</b> delights in freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and the frontier. Her temples are
        few in civilized lands, but her wayside shrines appear throughout the world. Halflings, merchants, and all types
        of adventurers are drawn to her worship, and many people raise a glass in her honor, viewing her as the god of luck.
        Her commandments are few:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you.</li>
        <li>Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty.</li>
        <li>Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Bahamut</b>, also called the Platinum Dragon, is the good-aligned god of justice, protection and nobilitiy. He is
        the patron of the dragonborn and the good-aligned metallic dragons. He was created when the dragon god Io was split
        in half; the other half became Tiamat, patron goddess of the evil-aligned chromatic dragons. Wise, intelligent and
        good, Bahamut's followers are not only metallic dragons and dragonborn, but also humans. </p>

      <p>He is stern and disapproves of evil, but kind and helpful to the downtrodden. His clerics and followers are taught
        to oppose evil and help those in need.</p>

      <p>He appears as a long and sinuous dragon with platinum scales and blue, cat-like eyes of shifting color, ranging from
        dark to light depending on his mood. His realm is located in Celestia, the Radiant Throne. He sometimes wanders the
        earth as a frail old man, with seven yellow canaries flying around his head that are really the seven golden dragons
        who accompany him in disguise.</p>

      <p><b>Bane</b> is the evil-aligned god of war and conquest. He rules from his fortress of Tuer-Chern, which he created
        around the dead god Tuern's throne. He battles endlessly with Gruumsh for supremacy.</p>

      <p><b>Corellon</b> is the deity of spring, the arts, magic, beauty and the fey. He is one of the patrons of the arcane
        arts and the Fey, along with Sehanine and Lolth, and thus is most frequently worshiped by elves and eladrin. He seeded
        the world with arcane magic and planted the most ancient forests. Artists and musicians worship him, as do those
        who view their spellcasting as an art, and his shrines can be found throughout the Feywild. He despises Lolth and
        her priestesses for leading the drow astray. He urges his followers thus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you’re casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing
          the arts of war.</li>
        <li>Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the
          world’s first days.</li>
        <li>Thwart the followers of Lolth at every opportunity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Corellon desires, above everything else, to protect and preserve the elven race. He wishes to thwart the schemes of
        the drow and the orcs, especially the followers of Gruumsh, since Corellon is said to have taken out the war god's
        left eye in an ancient battle. He advises his followers to avoid stagnation and always seek new experiences. Not
        only do half-elves and elves worship him, but also many bards. He dislikes those who defile the dead or flee from
        their enemies. His temples are found in many large elven cities, such as Enstad.</p>

      <p><b>Erathis</b> is the unaligned god of civilization, inventions and law. Rulers, judges, pioneers and devoted citizens
        worship her, and her temples are present in most major cities of the world. She is the patron of the minotaurs after
        having defeated the primordial Baphomet. She lives with Pelor in Hestavar, where they are known as "the King and
        Queen of Light" and rule the city.</p>

      <p>She is said to be in a relationship with Pelor and is allied with Moradin and Ioun. She is perhaps the only god on
        cordial terms with Asmodeus, King of the Nine Hells, as tyranny and dystopia are forms of civilization. Her antithesis
        is Melora, the unaligned goddess of wilderness, nature and the sea.</p>

      <p><b>Erathis</b> commands her devoted followers with three of her many laws:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Work with others to achieve your goals. Community and order are always stronger than individuals.</li>
        <li>Tame the wilderness to make it fit for habitation, and defend the light of civilization against darkness.</li>
        <li>Seek out new ideas, inventions, lands and wilderness. Build machines, cities and empires.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Gruumsh</b> is the chaotic evil god of destruction, and the lord of marauding hordes, though some are known to worship
        him as a war god. While Bane's followers conquer, Gruumsh's slaughter, representing the carnage of war. He is known
        as the One-Eyed God, supposedly due to losing his left eye in a battle against Corellon (although many of his worshippers
        claim that he was born with only one eye, and did not in fact lose it in battle). For this reason, his most devout
        followers, orcs, possess a lingering hatred for elves and eladrin. Many orc priests wear eye patches to show their
        devotion to Gruumsh.</p>

      <p>The followers of Gruumsh are told to conquer and destroy, crush the weak, breed and let their numbers flourish, and
        let nothing stand in their way.</p>

      <p>Gruumsh makes his lair in Chernoggar, where his forces clash with Bane's in an endless cycle of death and violence,
        all in the One-Eyed God's attempt to become the only war god in existence.</p>

      <p><b>Ioun</b> is the god of knowledge, skill, and prophecy. Sages, seers, and tacticians revere her, as do all who live
        by their knowledge and mental power. Corellon is the patron of arcane magic, but Ioun is the patron of its study.
        Libraries and wizard academies are built in her name. Her commands are also teachings:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Seek the perfection of your mind by bringing reason, perception, and emotion into balance with one another.</li>
        <li>Accumulate, preserve, and distribute knowledge in all forms. Pursue education, build libraries, and seek out lost
          and ancient lore.</li>
        <li>Be watchful at all times for the followers of Vecna, who seek to control knowledge and keep secrets. Oppose their
          schemes, unmask their secrets, and blind them with the light of truth and reason.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ioun is worshipped in the Temple of the Mind of Zerthadlun. She is said to be the second most popular deity among metallic
        dragons.
      </p>

      <p><b>Kord</b> is the storm god and the lord of battle. He revels in strength, battlefield prowess, and thunder. Fighters
        and athletes revere him. He is a mercurial god, unbridled and wild, who summons storms over land and sea; those who
        hope for better weather appease him with prayers and spirited toasts.</p>

      <p>He gives few commands:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Be strong, but do not use your strength for wanton destruction.</li>
        <li>Be brave and scorn cowardice in any form.</li>
        <li>Prove your might in battle to win glory and renown.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Lolth</b>, also called the Spider Queen and the Queen of the Demonweb Pits, is the chaotic evil god of shadow, lies,
        and spiders and the patron of the drow. Scheming and treachery are her commands, and her clerics are a constant force
        of disruption in the otherwise stable society of the evil drow. </p>

      <p>Temples dedicated to Lolth dominate drow society, and her clerics are always women. They lead the society and backstab
        each other for power and to earn their goddess' favor. Lolth is a cruel and demanding goddess that expects absolute
        loyalty from her followers. She will often test them and selects drow of great skill and power for her trial. If
        the drow succeeds in the trial, they will become a drider, but they are killed if they fail.</p>

      <p>The goddess of nature, wilderness and the sea, Melora is often worshiped by elves as well as hunters and rangers. She
        is the antithesis of Erathis, the deity of civilization, and is also known to dislike Asmodeus. She has no astral
        domain and prefers to simply wander the cosmos. Sailors often make offerings to her before they embark on their voyages.
        She commands her followers thusly: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Protect the wild places of the world from destruction and overuse. Oppose the rampant spread of cities and empires.</li>
        <li>Hunt aberrant monsters and other abominations of nature. </li>
        <li>Do not fear or condemn the savagery of the wild. Live in harmony with the wild. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Before the Dawn War, she was almost considered a sister of Erathis, but after the minotaurs broke away from Erathis,
        Melora and Kord combined their powers to destroy Ruul, causing discord among Melora and Earthis.</p>

      <p>She is strongly opposed to Baphomet, Gruumsh, Yeenoghu, Cryonax and their followers, in addition to the zealous followers
        of Erathis.</p>

      <p><b>Moradin</b> is the god of creation and patron of artisans, especially miners and smiths. He carved the mountains
        from primordial earth and is the guardian and protector of the hearth and the family. Dwarves from all walks of life
        follow him. He demands these behaviors of his followers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Meet adversity with stoicism and tenacity.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate loyalty to your family, your clan, your leaders, and your people.</li>
        <li>Strive to make a mark on the world, a lasting legacy. To make something that lasts is the highest good, whether you
          are a smith working at a forge or a ruler building a dynasty.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Pelor</b> is the good aligned god of the sun, agriculture and time as well as the seasonal god of summer. He is
        known as a healing god and is the most popular god among humans. His clerics are well respected and honored in most
        good aligned realms. </p>

      <p>He dwells in the in a palace called Aurosion in Hestavar with Erathis, goddess of civilization, inventions and law,
        who it is implied he is in a relationship with. The two are known as "the King and Queen of Light". </p>

      <p>While he opposes evil and the evil gods, he is the greatest enemy of the Chained God Tharizdun. His antithesis is the
        Raven Queen, goddess of death, fate and doom, and the seasonal goddess of winter.</p>

      <p>The name of the god of death is long forgotten, but she is called the <b>Raven Queen</b>. She is the spinner of fate
        and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites,
        in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to abide by these
        commandments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.</li>
        <li>Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish
          hubris where you find it.</li>
        <li>Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim
          the Raven Queen's throne.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>God of the moon and autumn, <b>Sehanine</b> is the patron of trickery and illusions. She has close ties to Corellon
        and Melora and is a favorite deity among elves and halflings. Scouts and thieves ask for her blessing on their work.
        Her teachings are simple:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Follow your goals and seek your own destiny.</li>
        <li>Keep to the shadows, avoiding the blazing light of zealous good and the utter darkness of evil.</li>
        <li>Seek new horizons and new experiences, and let nothing tie you down.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Tharizdun</b> is the evil god of madness and annihilation, and once ruled the Astral Domain Pandemonium in the Astral
        Sea.</p>

      <p>During the Dawn War, Tharizdun felt he needed no help from the gods to battle the primordials, just more power. He
        found that power in a shard of evil at the edge of the universe. When he touched the shard, he was transformed and
        twisted by the evil power of the shard into something unrecognizable. The dark god drove the shard into the maelstrom
        that would one day become the Elemental Chaos and there, the shard spawned the Infinite Layers of the Abyss and the
        demons. Tharizdun hoped to use this new race as soldiers in his war, but they proved too chaotic to control, so he
        left.
      </p>

      <p>He may also have been the unnamed god that peeked through the Living Gate with Pelor and Ioun, and later killed its
        guardian and destroyed it, allowing the Far Realm to enter the Astral Sea.</p>

      <p>As a result of creating the Abyss, Tharizdun was imprisoned by the other gods and sealed away in another plane. His
        name is not known by many, even among his followers. He is often referred to as the Chained God.</p>

      <p>Even imprisoned, he managed to find a way to influence some, causing them to believe he is a primordial seeking to
        destroy the gods who imprisoned him. They call him the Elder Elemental Eye, not knowing that he and the Chained God
        are the same being.</p>

      <p>His followers now work to free him. Many of them are insane and do not realize that releasing Tharizdun from imprisonment
        means that he will seek to destroy all of creation.</p>

      <p><b>Tiamat</b> is the goddess of greed and envy. Known as the Chromatic Dragon, Tiamat was born when the dragon god
        Io was split in half, the other god created in this process being her brother Bahamut. She is the mother of the evil
        chromatic dragons. Her followers, both dragon and non-dragon, are encouraged to conquer as much land and hoard as
        much wealth as they can. Few dragons keep shrines to her in their lairs for fear she will demand part of their treasure
        hoard.</p>

      <p>The Chromatic Dragon can appear as a beautiful human female wearing a red dress and jewelry, but her true form is a
        terrifying wrym with five heads, each the head of one of the five chromatic dragons (black, red, blue, green and
        white). Each of these heads can use the breath weapon that is associated with that type of dragon. Her body is a
        blend of each of the five different chromatic dragon scale colors, and has a long tail with a poisonous stinger.</p>

      <p>Tiamat embodies the jealousy and greed of the chromatic dragons, and she is primarily concerned with spreading evil
        and propagating the chromatic dragons as a species. She holds grudges and never forgives slights. She demands reverence
        and tribute from her subjects. Blue and green dragons obey her most readily, and kobolds are also known to worship
        her.
      </p>

      <p>Tiamat's priests are known as Wyrmkeepers or Wyrmlairds, and are usually evil. Her church has a very rigid hierarchy,
        and her priests are often preoccupied with undermining other faiths and hoarding vast amounts of wealth. Her temples
        are often built in the lairs of deceased dragons and are filled with piles of gold and silver to be offered to her,
        as well as traps to deter the unfaithful.</p>

      <p><b>Torog</b>, The King that Crawls, is a deity. He is the evil god of the Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers.</p>

      <p><b>Vecna</b> is the evil god of secrets, the undead and necromancy. He is usually depicted as a mummified, desiccated
        corpse missing his left hand and left eye. His many titles include the Arch-Lich, the Maimed God and the Whispered
        One. He was first introduced in the World of Greyhawk D&amp;D setting.</p>

      <p>Born a mortal wizard, he ascended to lichdom after assuming a mastery of the dark arts that no mortal had ever achieved,
        before or since. He is considered to be the most powerful wizard and lich to ever exist, as well as the most evil.
        At the height of his power, he was betrayed by his trusted lieutenant, the vampire Kas the Bloody-Handed, who destroyed
        Vecna's mortal body, leaving only his left hand and left eye behind. Sometime after the battle, Vecna rose to godhood
        and now seeks to usurp the powers and positions of all other gods until he is the only god left in existence. He
        is opposed by good gods and some evil gods. While he does not like the Raven Queen, he prefers her to Orcus as the
        god of death. Vecna's symbol is a left hand holding an eye, to represent the two pieces of his body that were left
        after his mortal form was destroyed by Kas.</p>

      <p><b>Ioun </b> often considered to be Vecna's antithesis, because she wishes to share with the world all the knowledge
        that Vecna would rather keep secret.</p>

      <p><b>Zehir</b> is the evil god of darkness, poison, and assassins. Snakes are his favored creation, and the yuan-ti revere
        him above all other gods.</p>
