      <h1>Races</h1>

      <p>All races in the D&amp;D books are available for play, except for the monstrous races. There are some slight lore differences
        for some, however.</p>

      <h2>Dragonborn</h2>

      <p>Unable to reproduce, dragonborn are exceptionally rare. They can only be created by true dragons, the means of which
        are not understood. Since dragons must go out of their way to create dragonborn, they are often created to serve
        a specific purpose which they rarely deviate from. As a result, many are exceptionally wary of the chromatic variants.</p>

      <h2>Dwarves</h2>

      <p>Dwarves believe the entire world is a large, sleeping dwarf. The winds are its breath, waters its tears, and dwarves
        themselves were formed in its womb beneath the ground. They are widespread, but have a deep-seated fear of water
        where they believe the grave is. Ancestor worship is common among dwarves, and many follow the barbarian Path of
        the Ancestral Guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>Elves</h2>

      <p>Elves see themselves as children of the heavenly bodies. Wood elves are the children of the day, dark elves are children
        of the night, and high elves are children of the sun, or moon. Notably, not all dark elves are hated and reviled,
        nor do they primarily dwell in the Underdark. They are simply elves that are primarily nocturnal. </p>

      <h2>Gnomes</h2>

      <p>Like dwarves, gnomes see their origins in the earth. Not in the depths, but rather the stones on the surface. Many
        gnomes dedicate themselves to discovery and innovation, but tribes of wild gnomes have been known to raid small villages.
        These gnomes attack with terrifying ferocity and cruel spiked armor. This fighting style and their small size has
        earned them the nickname “Burrs”.</p>

      <h3>Wild Gnomes</h3>

      <p>Wild gnomes often follow the path of a barbarian. Those trained in the use of spiked armor may take the Path of the
        Battlerager.
      </p>

      <p><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>

      <p><b><i>Bad Reputation.</i></b> You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>

      <p><b><i>Fury of the Small.</i></b> When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger
        than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your
        level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Halflings</h2>

      <p>Halflings are one of the oldest races in the world, their small stature enabling them to go unnoticed among the early
        titans and primordials. Ruined halfling civilizations from ages past are not uncommon.</p>

      <h2>Humans</h2>

      <p>Humans are widespread and diverse. No one is sure of their origins, although some believe that humans are simply tall
        halflings. They are highly adaptable, often taking on traits from other races that live near them. For example, humans
        who have been exposed to dwarves may follow the Path of the Ancestral Guardian, or those who live near elves may
        have learned Bladesong.
      </p>

      <p>Many humans are naturally quite talented. To reflect this, you can use the variant human, taking a feat reflecting
        this natural talent. Alternatively, if you use the base human, you gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your
        choice.
      </p>

        after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>

      </p>

      <h2>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h2>

      <p>If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, or fail two death saving throws, roll a d100 and consult the following
        table when you regain consciousness. </p>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>

            </td>
          </tr>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Encumbrance</h2>

      <p>Just be realistic. You probably can’t walk quickly carrying an aurochs, the wagon it was pulling, <i>and</i> your equipment.</p>

      <h2>Fighting Styles</h2>

      <p><b><i>Two-Weapon Fighting.</i></b> Starting at eleventh level, if you have the Extra Attack feature and you engage
        in two-weapon fighting, you can make two attacks on your bonus action instead of one.</p>

      <h2>Thrown Weapons</h2>

      <p>When you throw a weapon as part of your attack action, you may draw a weapon with both the light and thrown properties
        for every weapon you throw.<br />
      </p>

      <h1>Religion</h1>

      <h2>The Grey Faith</h2>

      <p>The main religion in civilized areas is the Grey Faith. It holds the premise that the world is composed of Light and
        Dark, and one cannot exist without the other. The Light is usually associated with life, joy, victory, and art, while
        the Dark is associated with death, loss, secrecy, and sleep. There are adherents who are drawn toward either the
        Light or the Dark, but as elements of Dark and Light are heavily entwined in all aspects of life and the world, they
        are most commonly venerated together. It is this blending from which the Faith takes its name.</p>

      <p>Dark and Light are not viewed as deities, as that entire concept is from a less enlightened time. Instead, it is more
        accurate to view them as energies, or forces. At first glance, it may seem that Light represents goodness, and Dark
        represents evil, this is not entirely true. The pursuit of joy has led many to fall into depraved lives, and the
        recovery from loss has formed the most celebrated heroes.</p>

      <p> Clerics of the Grey Faith may belong to any domain, depending on how that manifests. Knowledge, Light, and Trickery
        are most common for Grey, Light, and Dark clerics, respectively. Many of the Grey Faith’s are not clerics, but monks
        or paladins instead. Clerics devote themselves to the care of all, monks to the pursuit of self-perfection and enlightenment,
        and paladins to specific causes of the faith.</p>

      <h2>Folk Religion</h2>

      <p>As you move further from the major cities, the concept of deities grows more prevalent. In small towns and villages,
        stories are told of when powerful beings formed the world and warred against each other. Not wishing to mar their
        creation further, they have since retreated from the physical world, though their influence can still be felt. Many
        pantheons of deities have been suggested. The most popular is shown below, however others still hold sway.</p>

      <p>The concept of deities becomes less common again as you move into older, wilder places. Here, religions become animistic
        instead, and for good reason. In these old, untamed places, there are rumours that powerful spirits manifest and
        walk through them.</p>
